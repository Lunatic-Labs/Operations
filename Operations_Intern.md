# Operations Intern


## Summary

The role of the Operations Intern is to assist the student developers by providing the needed resources to ensure the success of each team&#39;s project. This assistance comes in the form of both providing instructional materials as well as allocating cloud services provided by Lunatic Labs.

## Procedures

**Organizational Hierarchy** _- Questions and concerns of the Operations Intern should first be issued to the Operations Manager. Upon review of the inquiry the Operations Manager may choose to elevate the inquiry to the Lunatic Labs Advisors or instruct the Operations Intern to approach an Advisor directly._


**Slack** _-_ _Slack is the primary method of communication between the Lunatic Labs Operations team. Internal communications are processed through the #internal-ops channel while student developers request assistance through the #operations channel._

Student Requests (#operations) - Student requests through the #operations channel should be handled promptly by the next available intern on the operations team. Below are some guidelines on processing student requests:

- Upon receiving a student request the operations team will provide verification to the student that their request has been received by either replying with a short message or simply using the Slack reaction :eyes: to notify the student their issue is being looked into. Verification of receiving the request should happen by the operations team no later than 24hrs after the request is issued.
- Although some rudimentary requests may prescribe a quick straightforward answer for more complex queries the Operations Interns should respond in a way that promotes the learning of the student and leads them to the solution rather than handing it to them outright. Guidance for the request should be issued no later than 72hrs after receiving the request. An update should be provided to the student for any request that hasn&#39;t been completed within the 72hr window.
- Operations Interns take possession of a particular request by replying or reacting to it but may solicit the assistance of other interns with the request through the #internal-ops channel.
- Upon completion of a student request the Operations Intern should verify with the student that their issue has been addressed and upon receiving verification mark the thread with the reaction :white\_check\_mark: to signify its completion.
- An audit of outstanding requests should be the first priority of the Operations Intern upon clocking in.

Internal-ops - The #internal-ops channel should be utilized for inter-team communications and be a place for general collaboration between the interns on student requests and on operational and administrative challenges issued by the Operations Manager.


**Email** _-_ _Email may be utilized when the feature set of Slack is deemed inadequate but an effort should be made to consolidate company correspondence within the Lunatic Labs #operations and #internal-ops channels and via Slack direct message where appropriate._


**Company Meetings** _-_ _Company meetings are the main vessel in which the Advisors will disseminate information to the student developers. Company meetings are billable hours for the Operations Interns and should be tracked through the Operations Jibble. Although the Operations Interns should be present and attentive during company meetings the meetings are primarily an exercise for the student developers. Additional conduct guidelines for company meetings are listed below:_

- Remote interns should participate in the Company Meeting Zoom with their mics muted and video on. This shows a visible, tangible presence of the team to the student developers without unintended audio interruptions.
- Operations Interns should stand by for questions directed to the team by in-class participants or those submitted during the meetings via Slack.
- Although the Operations Interns may have valuable input regarding the student projects presented during company meetings, providing that input contradicts the &quot;learn by doing&quot; experience that Lunatic Labs wishes to provide. Instead, Operations Interns should make note of the potential pitfalls of the project and have the related guidance on stand-by should the students reach that area of development and find they are unable to overcome the obstacle without assistance.


**Operations Challenges** _-_ _Operational Challenges will be issued to the Operations Interns by the Operations Manager as an exercise to increase their knowledge on relevant software development tool stacks and skill sets. The result of these challenges, regardless of the main deliverables, will be an operations curated tutorial on the relevant tool or resource. Operations Interns should be diligent in documenting their discoveries as this will be the way in which they assist student developers when the students reach similar milestones of development._


**Reporting** _-_ _Weekly progress will be tracked via an archive of progress report documentation on the Lunatic Labs GitHub. Each week the Operations Manager will provide a templatized report dated for the current week under the &quot;Progress Reports&quot; folder of the Operations GitHub repository. Operations Interns are responsible for filing out their respective SCRUM-style questions within the report before 11:59 p.m. on Thursday each week. Answers to the questions should emphasize the individual&#39;s contribution to the team&#39;s progress as opposed to the team&#39;s progress in general. The report will then be summarized and submitted by the Operations Manager to the Operations Advisors on Friday for review._


**Cloud Resource Allocation** _- TODO -_ _[This section will detail the process for approving and allocating Lunatic Labs cloud resources to student developers]_

# Progress Report

**4 Feb 2021 - 12 Feb 2021**

# Summary

This week the team completed the Magic Eight Ball Ops Challenge adding database functionality to their front end site. They hosted the website on a GCP cloud engine while connecting to a mysql database hosted on Cloud SQL. During Thrusday's company meeting a brief overview of the Google Cloud Service document was presented to the student developers to get them onboarded with the use of the Google Cloud Platform. Among the lessons learned during this Ops challenge was a realization about the team's workflow. Up until this point the team had been operating under a self-paced structure that only met outside company meetings once a week to check on progress and delegate new tasks. This structure proved to be sub optimal for our team makeup as it was discovered that the team made the most strides towards the intended goals when collaborating simultaneously as opposed to trying to combine individual modular efforts. The plan moving forward is to meet as a team on the days we do not have company meetings to spend at least an hour on collborative work and assisting one another with personal roadblocks and integration of individual progress. In the coming week the team will begin a new Ops Challenge where they will build a comparative web presence table that illustrates the common elements shared between top software companies inside the U.S. This will serve as a reference model when building the web architecture of Lunatic Labs.  

# Operation Interns

1. What progress have I made this week?

* In my effort to make up for a bad week last week, there was miscommunication with regard to meeting times and who was doing what on the project.  Thanks to a great team helping me out, it appears that these are mostly resolved.  (Mostly instead of definitely because I don't like to claim success too soon.)

* Installed MySQL Workbench.

* I've been meeting with my assigned groups, and they both are making great progress.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

* I will continue meeting with my assigned groups and answering questions.

* Add my times to the calendar.

* Review latest changes to the eightball project.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

* Currently mostly psychological, as I'm worried I've not made a good impression on the group so far.

* Please understand that, prior to this semester, I have literally not done anything school or work related **for an entire year and a half**.  I've finished all school work except for the internship, and I couldn't get hired anywhere cause of lack of experience and no degree (and then Covid), so I literally had nothing to do.  When forced to go through that, bad habits will quite certainly develop that take time to undo.  Add this to disabilities that make things take an average of 3x longer than others can do the same thing in, and I'm left way behind and falling even further.

* I'm beginning to wonder if this is even the right field for me, which is rather terrifying considering I've spent 21 semesters in college already, and I'm literally one course away from graduating with a degree in this field with no training in anything else (and still no job lined up for after this semester).

* I'm not directing this at anyone in particular.  I'm just worried I'll be "that guy" everyone's glad to be rid of.

## Victoria Ludwig

1. What progress have I made this week?

This past week Zach and I realized that PHP would be better suited for creating the eightball website. PHP has much more capabilities for connecting to databases and storing data. Zach, Eddie, and I were able to recreate the website using PHP and connect it to a mySQL database through Google Cloud Services using a mySQLi connection. The eightball website now stores the data in a database, accessible on the Google Cloud Platform.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

I intend to use my newfound knowledge of creating/hosting a website and storing data through it to help the teams of Lunatic Labs work on their website-related issues. I would like to 'continue' this project by linking the domain name I own to the website that is up and running. If I am able to, I will likely add how to do that to the informational Google Doc.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

Currently, since the project is complete, nothing as of now.


## Zach Jacobs

1. What progress have I made this week?

Continued and finished work on the Magic Eightball challenge by working with Victoria and Eddie. Some of my contribution was in creating the how-tos of the document including: creating a new project, creating a new VM, and creating a new database. I also spun up a database and VM that was used in completing the project.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

I intend on providing aid to students neededing to use Google Cloud services and any other issues that may arise.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

Google Shell does not work very well with Firefox so I had to switch to Google Chrome. Other than that there are no current roadblocks.

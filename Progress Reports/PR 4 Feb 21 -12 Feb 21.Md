1. What progress have I made this week?

This past week Zach and I realized that PHP would be better suited for creating the eightball website. PHP has much more capabilities for connecting to databases and storing data. Zach, Eddie, and I were able to recreate the website using PHP and connect it to a mySQL database through Google Cloud Services using a mySQLi connection. The eightball website now stores the data in a database, accessible on the Google Cloud Platform.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

I intend to use my newfound knowledge of creating/hosting a website and storing data through it to help the teams of Lunatic Labs work on their website-related issues. I would like to 'continue' this project by linking the domain name I own to the website that is up and running. If I am able to, I will likely add how to do that to the informational Google Doc.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

Currently, since the project is complete, nothing as of now.

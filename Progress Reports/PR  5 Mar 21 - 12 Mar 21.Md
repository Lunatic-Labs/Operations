# Progress Report

**5 Mar 2021 - 12 Mar 2021**

# Summary

This week the operations team successfully added SSL certificaiton to a website hosted on Google Cloud. Upon completion of this objective a document was drafted detailing how to replicate the results. The team is currently in the process of testing the how-to doc to ensure no steps in the process were overlooked. After the discussion of ways in which we could breathe more life into the content of our company meetings the team suggested a source control day, specifically detailing the use of GitHub. In response, the team began an exploratory dive into the Git documentation to start developing an interactive exercise showcasing a broadscope, high-level view of Github's functionality. Once the company meetings detailing the definition of developer roles conclude the team plans to run the student developers through the source control exercise.

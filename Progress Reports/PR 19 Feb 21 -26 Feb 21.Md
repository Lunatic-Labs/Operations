# Progress Report

**19 Feb 2021 - 26 Feb 2021**

# Summary

This week the operations team completed the initial draft of the comparative feature document. The document effectively highlighted present trends among top software development companies across the country. They also continued their individual research on ways to increase overall security of web hosted applicaitons on Google Cloud Services. In addition to internal work on operational challenges the team assited the student developers with several requests submitted in the #operations channel. Among these were project repository permission issues and Github storage limits, both of which were prescribed a course of action by the team. Next week we plan to drill down further into each feature on the comparative feature diagram and describe some of the common content found within. We will also draft a list of possible concrete deliverables for lessons learned on GCP security.

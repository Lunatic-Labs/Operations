# Progress Report

**12 Mar 2021 - 19 Mar 2021**

# Summary

This week the team began to flesh out a lesson plan on GIT source control. The plan consists of teaching the students the fundamentals of GIT via a powerpoint lecture with breaks for pratical hands-on demos. The lesson will conclude with a Kaboom quiz highlighting the major takeaways of the powerpoint with a prize for the student who places first. The Ops team has already ran a mock presentation of the content and will continue to polish it until the lesson is performed. In the coming week the Ops interns will begin iterating on the development of Lunatics Labs web presence. Using lessons learned from the comparative feature diagram the interns will compile a rough outline detailing the technical makeup of the Lunatic Labs website. The team's next major push will be implementing this outline through creating the website's first draft.

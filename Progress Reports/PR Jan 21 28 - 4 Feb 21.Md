# Progress Report

**28 Jan 2021 - 4 Feb 2021**

# Summary

This week the team continued to iterate on their Magic Eight Ball Operations Challenge. They were successfull in hosting thier site on an EC2 AWS machine and giving the visitors to the site answers to their submitted questions. With the front end nearly complete the decision was made to switch platforms back to Google Cloud because of the availability of free educational credits. The team successfully migrated their front end site to GCP on the Cloud Engine service and have began research on the best cloud database product to connect their site to. The interns also continued in their attempts to apply for free educational credits on GCP but those who were successfull found they were only granted Quicklabs credits usable to complete tutorials and not actual dollar value credit to their GCP account.

In addition to the guidance and overseeing of the operations interns the ops manager migrated all current standard operating procedure documentation to the Github Wiki and created a table of conents in which to insert future materials. A draft of the ops manager procedures documentation was among the new materials inserted into the wiki. Although the interns were unable to redeem any dollar value credit to their accounts via online applications, upon Dr. Towells approval to disemminate educational credits, the ops manager was able to document and verify the process for the ops team and student developers to add 50$ worth of GCP credit to their personal accounts WITHOUT the need to input billing information.

In the coming week the ops team will iterate on finishing the Magic Eight Ball challenge by adding database functionality. We will also be drafting a comprehensive document that outlines the process for student developers to begin working with Google Cloud Services.

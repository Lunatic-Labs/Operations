1. What progress have I made this week?

I was able to research various tech companies in Nashville and determine what kinds of technologies they are using on their sites. This information will be important in determining what type of technologies we should use on our Lunatic Labs website.

I intend to link my Magic Eighball project to Google Cloud Services in order to apply SSL certification to the project. I also will work with students with any help they need, especially with Google Cloud Servies.

I was at first unable to understand and use the Linux command line in Google Cloud, but I am able to proficently work with it now.

Worked at researching various companies in Boston, MA to see what their web presence is like I ended up settling with Toast and Acquia. I filled out the tool stack spreadsheet for both of them.

I intend to find one more company to research. Search criteria will be more focused on smaller scale companies. We may also work on SSL certification on the previous ops challenge.

## Victoria Ludwig

1. What progress have I made this week?

I presented information to the students in class about using git, specifically on the command line. I believe the students learned a few things from it, based on student response from the end of class.
I need about 40 hours more, which means I will need to be putting in a bit more than 10 hours a week to complete the internship requirement.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

I will continue to work on the Lunatic Labs website, compiling information that the students send to me this coming week.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

None at this time.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

Begin full production of the website, with main focus being the homepage and contact page.

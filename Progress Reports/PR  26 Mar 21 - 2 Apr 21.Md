# Progress Report

**26 Mar 2021 - 2 Apr 2021**

# Summary

This week the team presented their lecture and interactive demo on Git Source Control to the student developers. They also began work on converting the template website into the design dictated by the comparative feature diagram. As we move into the month of April we will be focusing on delivering a minimum viable product for the website and drafting an end of semester spin down procedure document for both the student developer projects and internally as the operations team. Ops has taken stock of the current total hours each intern has worked and all members should be on track to meet their allotted hour requirement by April 22nd.

# Operation Interns

## Tate Richardson

1. What progress have I made this week?

Contributed to the git presentation and worked on the blog page for the website.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

Make sure the direction I'm going on the blog page is congruent with the rest of the design.

Attempting to compile and run code for one of the projects on my Windows machine to assess bugs.

Review of git principles for video.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

My Internship course structure is a bit different because of registration issues, so navigating that and graduation is stressful.

## Victoria Ludwig

1. What progress have I made this week?

I presented information to the students in class about using git, specifically on the command line. I believe the students learned a few things from it, based on student response from the end of class.
I need about 40 hours more, which means I will need to be putting in a bit more than 10 hours a week to complete the internship requirement.

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

I will continue to work on the Lunatic Labs website, compiling information that the students send to me this coming week.

1. What are the obstacles hindering me?

None at this time.



## Zach Jacobs

1. What progress have I made this week?

1. What is my plan for the week ahead?

Begin full production of the website, with main focus being the homepage and contact page.

No current obstacles.

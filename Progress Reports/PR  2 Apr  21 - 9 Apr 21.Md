This week the operations team continued their efforts in establishing a web presence for Lunatic Labs. The team created the Home, Team, Blog, and Projects webpages and formatted them for entry of student information upon submission. The team also curated a lesson on best practices for spinning down services and archiving project artifacts for the end of the semester and delivered it during the company meeting on 4/8. Next week is Spring Break, but the following week is the final week of the Lunatic Labs internship. During the final week the team will push to bring the four current webpages on the LL website to completion by inserting all of the student submittied images and descriptions into the project page as well as updating the Team page entry for each student developer. The interns will aslo conduct a final performance review with the advisors and the Ops Manager after which they will submit their internship portfolio and conclude the internship on 4/22.
